    "This question requires me to import the data, clean it, and store it in MongoDB. Nothing is said how and where the data should be imported and cleaned. The only specification, in my understanding, is that once data is cleaned, it has to be stored in MongoDB.\n",

    "So, my strategy for Question 1 will be to load each file in DataFrame, perform some basic investigation to familiarise myself with the data, then clean it and load it in MongoDB. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why I have chosen the use of DataFrame over MongoDB is that I find that DataFrames provide a wide array of built-in functions for data manipulation, making it straightforward to filter, sort and transform data. From looking at the Ofcom interactive report, it seems that the data is structured and performing various manipulations would be easier using DataFrames. I know that DataFrames are designed for in-memory computing, which can lead to faster processing times for data cleaning tasks. Having looked at the CSV files in Excel, I saw that the datasets are of medium-size and using DataFrames would be a suitable choice. Also, I am feeling more comfortable working with DataFrames."

The speed for each category of broadband is 30Mbit/s and greater for SFBB, 300Mbit/s and greater for UFBB. Regarding the speed of the Full Fibre Broadband, it is not entirely clear what speed it covers. In the 'Connected Nations 2019' metadata document, it is explained that the definition for full fibre coverage has been changed from year 2018. I carried additional checks of documents that are out of the scope of this TMA. I went to Ofcom's website and found the 'Connected Nations 2018' main report in order to find more information what exactly the definition changes for full fibre coverage are. Under 'Fixed broadband and voice service' section in the report, it is said that 'full fibre broadband' 'can offer speeds of 1Gbp/s', while in the 'Overview' section of the document it is said that the speed is 'of up to 1 Gbit/s'. So, from that, I think it is fair that we can conclude that Full Fibre Broabdand speed covers \n",

Here are my calculations:\n",

After a brief research, I understand that FWA is a method of delivering broadband internet services to premises using mobile netwrok technology rather than traditional wired connections such as copper or fibre optic cables. FWA can be particularly beneficial in rural or hard-to-reach areas where laying cables is impractical or too costly. \n",

This presents an ambiguity in how and what is done with the data. However, analysing the way the sentence is worded - 'it is no longer possible to identify', in my the word 'identify' signifies that the data is collected but combined with the rest of the SFBB data. In essence, that means that there is no way of differentiation between whether premises are receiving broadband with 30Mbit/s or higher from Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) or from the traditional wired connection. \n",

So, in order to achieve consistency throughout, the 2019 dataset needs to combine the 'Number of premises able to receive SFBB from FWA' and the 'Number of premises with SFBB availability'. Based on the statement given in the 'Connected Nations 2020 - About this data: Fixed coverage, local and unitoary authority area' it likely means that any premises able to receive Superfast Broadband (SFBB) speeds throguh FWA are now included within the broader 'Number of premises with SFBB availability' metric, rather than being reported separately. In the statement it does not say that such number of premises are excluded, hence why I think they have been included in the SFBB metrics. This adjustment would potentially create a more uniform and comparable series of data across years, reflecting total SFBB availability irrespective of the delivery technology.\n",

    "It seems that from datasets from 2020 onwards, UFBB speed is broken down into two subcategories - UFBB with speeds of 100Mbit/s or greater and UFBB with speeds of 300Mbit/s or greater. As we discovered earlier, SFBB covers any speed from 30Mbit/s and greater, covering any speeds from 30MBit/s with no upper limit, while UFBB covers any speed from 300Mbit/s and greater, with no upper limit. In other words, we do not have available data in 2019 dataset that differentiates any broadband speed from 100 Mbit/s or greater. In my understanding, this new category falls between SFBB and UFBB categoreis in 2019 dataset. Simply because SFBB covers anything from 30MBit/s, inlcuding UFBB speeds into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, one approach I can think of is to approximate the number of premises with 100 Mbit/s or more. Using the available data, to accurately represent premise with speeds of 100Mbit/s or greater, I would need to combine the counts of premises in both the '30<300Mbit/s' and '>=300Mbit/s' columns, as this would cover th entire range of speeds from just above 30Mbit/s through the highest speeds reported. However, it is worth noting that this approach would also include some premises with speeds between 30Mbit/s and 100Mbit/s. Given the absence of a direct 100Mbit/s threshold column in 2019, this is the closest approximation possible, in my opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding the number of premises for 30<300 Mbit/s and >=300Mbit/s would give me the total number of premises above 30Mbit/s. To refine this to just those likely to be 100Mbit/s or greater, I would calculate a distribution factor for 30<300Mbit/s and >=300Mbit/s columns for each area, and estimate the number of premises with 100 Mbit/s or greater. To establish the distribution factor for each area, I would calculate the proportion of premises that have speeds of >=300Mbit/s relative to the total number of premises with speeds of >=30Mbit/s. Then I will add the number of premises with 30<300Mbit/s and >= 300Mbit/s and divide the summed number by the factor for that area. I think this approach will give me a more granular data than just summing the 30<300Mbit/s and >=300Mbit/s and finding the average value. \n",

Perhaps, there might be much better statistical approaches that can be applied for such problem but I am not familiar with them."

I will also introduce two additional columns - 'Distribution factor' that will represent the distribtion factor and 'Estimated number of properties with 100Mbit/s or more' which will represent the approximate number of premises with 100Mbit/s or greater. Since I will be calculating the number of premises as well as the percentage for 100Mbit/s or more, I will also introduce a 'Estimated % of properties with 100Mbit/s or more' column that will represent the percentage of approximated number of premises with 100Mbit/s or more.

Since we have data from multiple years, I could build a model predicting the number of UFBB premises based on other factors, and then use this model to estimate the 100 Mbit/s availability. Also, regression analysis could be suitable if I have a continuous series of data points, such as in this case. However, I was not sure if we would be allowed to use such methods and techniques, as we have not been introduced to them (yet)."
